# End-to-End API Test

## Overview

Autonomous end-to-end testing workflow that:
1. Ensures the server is running (starts it if not)
2. Tests endpoints one by one with curl
3. Produces a Test Execution Document (TED) in `docs/reports/`

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

1. Read `.env` (or equivalent config) in the project root to extract:
   - `PORT` (detect from config, default `8000`)
   - Any API keys or auth tokens needed for authenticated endpoints
   - `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` (if applicable, for environment info)
2. Capture environment info for the TED:
   ```bash
   # Detect language/runtime version
   go version 2>/dev/null || python3 --version 2>/dev/null || node --version 2>/dev/null
   git branch --show-current
   git rev-parse --short HEAD
   ```
3. Examine the project to understand:
   - What endpoints exist (check OpenAPI spec, route definitions, or handler files)
   - Which endpoints require authentication
   - Which endpoints use caching
   - What the health/readiness endpoint is

### Step 2: Ensure Server is Running

Check if the server is already listening on the port:

```bash
lsof -i :$PORT -t 2>/dev/null
```

**If a process IS found:** Verify it's responding by hitting the health/readiness endpoint:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:$PORT/health
```

- If 200 → server is healthy, skip to Step 3
- If not 200 → warn user that port is occupied but not responding, ask what to do

**If NO process is found:** Start the server. Detect the project type and try appropriate strategies:

**Go projects:**
- Strategy A: `make api-dev` or `make dev` (if Makefile exists with dev target)
- Strategy B: `go run ./cmd/api` or `go run ./cmd/server` or `go run main.go`
- Strategy C: Build and run binary

**Python projects:**
- Strategy A: `make dev` or relevant Makefile target
- Strategy B: `uvicorn` or `gunicorn` or `python -m flask run`

**Node.js projects:**
- Strategy A: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
- Strategy B: `node server.js` or `node index.js`

Use `run_in_background: true`. Set `SERVER_STARTED_BY_SKILL=true` to track cleanup.

**Important for Go projects:** `envconfig` reads OS env vars, not `.env` files. When running the binary directly, you MUST source `.env` first with `set -a; source .env; set +a`.

### Step 2b: Bootstrap External Auth Dependencies (OIDC, etc.)

If the endpoints under test require admin/session authentication and the server logs warn that an external identity provider is unreachable (e.g. "OIDC provider not ready at boot", 503 on admin routes, or auth middleware failing to initialize), check whether the project ships a local substitute/mock for that provider before giving up on auth-gated tests.

1. Search for a mock auth service in the repo: look for directories/binaries like `cmd/*-mock/`, `cmd/mock-*`, or a README/SOP describing a local OIDC/Authentik/Auth0 substitute (e.g. this repo's `docs/sop/013-staging-mock-pre-merge-ritual.md` and `cmd/staging-mock/README.md`).
2. If one exists, read its README/SOP for exact env vars and start it in the background (`run_in_background: true`), matching the issuer URL, client ID, and client secret already configured in the project's `.env` (do not invent new values — they must match what the main server expects).
3. Restart or wait for the main server to retry OIDC discovery — some servers only discover the provider at boot and need a restart once the mock is up; check the server log for a line like "OIDC provider initialized" or "Admin auth mode resolved" before proceeding.
4. To obtain an authenticated session for testing: use the mock's login/authorize flow through the app's real login endpoint (e.g. `curl -c cookies.txt ".../admin/auth/login" -L`) rather than calling the mock directly — this exercises the real callback/session-issuance code path. Check the mock's docs for how to select a test role/user (e.g. a `role=` param defaulting to an admin role).
5. Track this as a skill-managed dependency too: if you started the mock, stop it in Step 7 cleanup alongside the main server.

**Example (this repo, Lexicon backend):** `cmd/staging-mock` substitutes for Authentik. `.env` already has `AUTHN_ADMIN_ISSUER=http://127.0.0.1:8088` and `AUTHN_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET=dev-local-secret` — start the mock with matching `STAGING_MOCK_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `STAGING_MOCK_CLIENT_ID=admin-bff-staging`, and `STAGING_MOCK_CLIENT_SECRET=dev-local-secret` after generating a signing key (`openssl genrsa -out /tmp/staging-mock.key 2048`), then restart the API server so it picks up the now-live issuer. Note: cookie-authenticated mutations on this project also require an `Origin` header matching `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL` (CSRF defense-in-depth) — add `-H "Origin: $ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL"` to authenticated POST/PATCH/DELETE test requests.

### Step 3: Wait for Readiness

Poll the health/readiness endpoint until the service is fully operational:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:$PORT/health)
  if [ "$STATUS" = "200" ]; then
    echo "Service ready"
    break
  fi
  echo "Waiting for service... (attempt $i)"
  sleep 2
done
```

If not ready within 60 seconds, stop and report the failure.

Verify and capture readiness details:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:$PORT/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Step 4: Determine Test Scope

1. If the user specified a feature or endpoint in the invocation arguments, use that scope directly.
2. Otherwise, discover available endpoints by reading:
   - OpenAPI spec (e.g., `api/openapi.yaml`, `openapi.json`)
   - Route definitions in source code
   - README or API documentation
3. Present discovered endpoint groups to the user and ask which to test:
   - Individual endpoint groups
   - All endpoints

### Step 5: Execute Tests (One by One)

Test each endpoint **sequentially** (not in parallel — respect rate limits).

For each endpoint, execute these test categories as applicable:

#### 5.1 Test Categories

| Category | When to Run | What to Test |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Happy path | Always | Valid request, verify 200 and correct response structure |
| i18n | Endpoints with user-facing messages (if i18n is supported) | Repeat with different `Accept-Language`, verify localized response |
| Error cases | Endpoints with path/query params | Invalid params → 400, non-existent resource → 404 |
| Cache validation | Endpoints with caching | Compare 1st vs 2nd call timing, verify identical responses |

**Detecting cached endpoints:** Search handler code for Redis/cache patterns (`redis.Get`, `redis.Set`, `cache.Get`, etc.)

**Detecting authenticated endpoints:** Search for auth middleware, API key checks, or JWT validation in handlers/routes.

#### 5.2 Curl Templates

**GET (public):**
```bash
curl -s -w "\n---\nHTTP_STATUS: %{http_code}\nTIME: %{time_total}s\nSIZE: %{size_download} bytes\n" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "http://localhost:$PORT/ENDPOINT"
```

**GET (authenticated):**
```bash
curl -s -w "\n---\nHTTP_STATUS: %{http_code}\nTIME: %{time_total}s\nSIZE: %{size_download} bytes\n" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:$PORT/ENDPOINT"
```

**POST:**
```bash
curl -s -w "\n---\nHTTP_STATUS: %{http_code}\nTIME: %{time_total}s\nSIZE: %{size_download} bytes\n" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "value"}' \
  "http://localhost:$PORT/ENDPOINT"
```

**Cache validation (timing comparison):**
```bash
TIME1=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}" "http://localhost:$PORT/ENDPOINT")
TIME2=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}" "http://localhost:$PORT/ENDPOINT")
echo "First: ${TIME1}s, Cached: ${TIME2}s"
```

#### 5.3 Recording Results

For each test, record:
- Endpoint path and method
- Description of what's being tested
- HTTP status code (actual vs expected)
- Complete JSON response body (pipe through `python3 -m json.tool` for formatting)
- Response time
- Pass/fail determination

**Important:** Capture the COMPLETE response body for every test. Never truncate or summarize.

#### 5.4 Test Execution Order

For each endpoint group, test in this order:
1. Happy path with default parameters
2. Happy path with specific parameters/filters
3. i18n validation (if applicable)
4. Error handling (invalid input, not found)
5. Cache validation (if cached endpoint)

### Step 6: Generate Test Execution Document (TED)

Create the TED at `docs/reports/TEST_EXECUTION_REPORT_<FEATURE>.md`.

If testing all features, name it `TEST_EXECUTION_REPORT_FULL.md`.
If testing a specific feature, name it `TEST_EXECUTION_REPORT_<FEATURE>.md`.

#### Response Body Policy

**Always include complete JSON response bodies** — never truncate or summarize. Use `<details>` blocks to keep the report scannable while preserving full data for reviewers.

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Include full responses | Show the real output exactly as returned |
| Use `<details>` blocks | Wrap responses in collapsible sections |
| Pretty-print JSON | Use `python3 -m json.tool` or `jq .` |
| Error responses too | Include the exact error text/JSON verbatim |

#### TED Template

```markdown
# Test Execution Document: <Feature/Scope>

**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** <current git branch>
**Base URL:** http://localhost:<PORT>
**Status:** ALL TESTS PASSED | TESTS FAILED

## Summary

| Category | Tests | Passed | Failed | Avg Response Time |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Happy Path | X | X | 0 | X.XXs |
| i18n | X | X | 0 | X.XXs |
| Error Handling | X | X | 0 | X.XXs |
| Cache Validation | X | X | 0 | X.XXs |
| **Total** | **X** | **X** | **0** | **X.XXs** |

## Environment

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Runtime Version | <language/runtime version> |
| Branch | <git branch> |
| Commit | <git short SHA> |
| Database | <healthy/unhealthy (host:port/db) or N/A> |
| Cache | <healthy/unhealthy (host:port) or N/A> |

## Test Results

### <Endpoint Group Name>

#### Happy Path

| # | Endpoint | Method | Description | Status | Expected | Result | Time |
|---|----------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | /v1/feature | GET | Default params | 200 | 200 | PASS | 0.05s |

<details>
<summary>Request/Response Details</summary>

**Request:**
\`\`\`bash
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:8000/v1/feature"
\`\`\`

**Response:**
\`\`\`json
{
    "complete": "json response here"
}
\`\`\`

- Observations about the response data

</details>

#### i18n Validation

| # | Endpoint | Language | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---|----------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | /v1/feature?page=0 | en | English error | PASS |
| 2 | /v1/feature?page=0 | id | Localized error | PASS |

<details>
<summary>i18n Response Details</summary>

**Language A:**
\`\`\`json
{"error": "English message"}
\`\`\`

**Language B:**
\`\`\`json
{"error": "Localized message"}
\`\`\`

</details>

#### Error Handling

| # | Endpoint | Scenario | Status | Expected | Result | Time |
|---|----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|------|
| 3 | /v1/feature/INVALID | Invalid ID | 400 | 400 | PASS | 0.01s |
| 4 | /v1/feature/NOTFOUND | Not found | 404 | 404 | PASS | 0.01s |

<details>
<summary>Error Response Details</summary>

**Test 3 — Invalid ID:**
\`\`\`bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/v1/feature/INVALID"
\`\`\`

**Response:**
\`\`\`
exact error text here
\`\`\`

</details>

### Cache Validation

| # | Endpoint | Description | First Call | Cached Call | Speedup |
|---|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 5 | /v1/feature | Cache hit | 0.050s | 0.008s | 6.3x |

Both calls return 200 with identical response sizes, confirming caching.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All endpoints return correct status codes
- [ ] Response Content-Type is application/json
- [ ] Error responses include appropriate error messages
- [ ] i18n works for supported languages (where applicable)
- [ ] Authenticated endpoints reject missing/invalid credentials
- [ ] Caching reduces response times on subsequent calls (where applicable)
- [ ] Empty results return valid empty-collection structure
- [ ] Response times are within acceptable range (<100ms cached, <2s uncached)

## Commands Executed

\`\`\`bash
# All curl commands used during testing, in execution order
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

<Summary: total tests, pass/fail, key observations, data availability notes, readiness>
```

### Step 7: Cleanup

After all tests are complete and the TED is written:

1. **If `SERVER_STARTED_BY_SKILL=true`**: Stop the server process
   ```bash
   # Kill the server started by this skill
   pkill -f "./bin/api" 2>/dev/null || pkill -f "go run" 2>/dev/null
   # or kill the PID captured during startup
   ```
   Also stop any auth mock started in Step 2b the same way (find its PID or match its process pattern, e.g. `pkill -f "go run ./cmd/staging-mock"`).
2. **If the server was already running**: Leave it running (don't kill it)
3. Inform the user of the TED location
4. Summarize pass/fail counts

## Important Notes

- **Sequential execution**: Test endpoints one by one. Do not run curl requests in parallel (respect rate limits)
- **Complete responses**: Always include full JSON response bodies. Use `<details>` blocks for scannability
- **Database data**: Tests depend on actual data. Empty results are not failures — note this in the TED
- **Env var loading**: When running binaries directly, ensure environment variables are loaded from `.env` or equivalent
- **Adapt to the project**: Read the project structure, Makefile, and config to determine the correct commands for starting the server, the health endpoint path, authentication mechanism, etc.
